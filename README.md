## Data repository for the manuscript Genome assembly and evolutionary analysis of the mandarin duck *Aix galericulata* reveal strong genome conservation among ducks

__Abstract__

The mandarin duck, *Aix galericulata*, is popular in East Asian cultures and displays exaggerated sexual dimorphism, especially in feather traits during breeding seasons. We generated and annotated the first mandarin duck *de novo* assembly, which was 1.085 Gb in size and encoded 16,615 proteins. Using a phylogenomic approach calibrated with fossils and molecular divergences, we inferred that the last common ancestor of ducks occurred 13.3â€“26.7 million years ago. The majority of the mandarin duck genome repetitive sequences belonged to the chicken repeat 1 (CR1) retroposon CR1-J2_Pass, which underwent a duck lineage-specific burst. Synteny analyses among ducks revealed infrequent chromosomal rearrangements in which breaks were enriched in LINE retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Calculation of the dN/dS ratio revealed that the majority of duck genes were under strong purifying selection. The expanded gene families in the mandarin duck are primarily involved in olfactory perception as well as the development and morphogenesis of feather and branching structures. This new reference genome will improve our understanding of the morphological and physiological characteristics of ducks and provide a valuable resource for functional genomics studies to investigate the feather traits of the mandarin duck.

This repository contains the following intermediate data sets so potential readers can access for further analyses or to repeat the analyses used here.
- `Divergene.dating.merged.nuc.fasta.gz`: the merged codon alignment used to estimate the divergence of the species tree (inferred using ASTRAL; only topology was used)
- `Gene.trees.fasta.and.alignments.zip`: the alignments and original sequence (in fasta) that used to make all the gene trees for the ASTRAL tree
- `gene.trees.zip`: all the gene trees used to make the final ASTRAL tree
- `PAML.ducks.pairwise.alignments.zip`: alignment for PAML duck analyses (used to make Fig 5a)
- `PAML.whole.phylogeny.single.copy.ortholog.zip`: alignments for PAML bird lineage analyses (used to make Fig 5b)
